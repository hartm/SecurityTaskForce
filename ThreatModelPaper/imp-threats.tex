\section{Implementation Threats}
These are the most common type of bug and what most security techniques address.

\paragraph{Poor Consensus Implementation.} Consensus implementations are very tricky to get correct, and a small bug can completely break the system.

\paragraph{Poor Memory Management.} In non-memory safe languages, buffer overflows and other memory issues could be problems.

\paragraph{Logging Secrets.} Poor data classification would lead to logging the secret information while program execution. Adversary can gain the function through log traces with leaked information.

\paragraph{Unchecked Dependencies.} Any software would make use of libraries, it is possible that a library or dependency used for building the code could have vulnerability. Another most likely concern is that one of the dependent library is no longer maintained or has warnings issued against.

\paragraph{Feature Incomplete Code / Undocumented Code.} Obsfurcation is not a risk mitigation, developers add the feature incomplete code that may go in to the next release. This will let adversaries make use of the incomplete feature ready code against the will of user.
